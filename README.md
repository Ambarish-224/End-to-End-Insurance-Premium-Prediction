### 1. Data Ingestion: 
* Data ingestion is the process in which unstructured data is extracted from one or multiple sources and then prepared for training machine learning models.

### 2. Data Validation:
* Data validation is an integral part of ML pipeline. It is checking the quality of source data before training a new mode
* It focuses on checking that the statistics of the new data are as expected (e.g. feature distribution, number of categories, etc). 

### 3. Data Transformation 
* Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that would be more suitable for model building.
* It is an imperative step in feature engineering that facilitates discovering insights.

### 4. Model Training
* Model training in machine learning is the process in which a machine learning (ML) algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from.

### 5. Model Evaluation
* Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
* Model evaluation is important to assess the efficacy of a model during initial research phases, and it also plays a role in model monitoring.

### 6. Model Deployement
* Deployment is the method by which we integrate a machine learning model into production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.
